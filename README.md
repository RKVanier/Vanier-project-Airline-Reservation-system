  The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is a program that helps manage flight bookings for both
  passengers and admins. Passengers can search for flights, book tickets, and make changes to their
  bookings, like canceling or updating them. Admins check and confirm bookings, keep track of
  passenger details, and manage all the information about flights, pilots, crew members, and booking
  reports.
